# HackRU

This requires ngrok to run

This is a Hack created at HackRU using python and Twilio API's. It is a secure communication method between teachers and students all through one centrilized number. The number of the teacher and student are never shared with eachother. Teachers are the admin so they are able to talk to all the students collectively or individual students and set up automatic notifications to remind students about upcoming assignments.
